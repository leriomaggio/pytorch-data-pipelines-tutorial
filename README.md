## Teaser

In this tutorial we will dive into the main features and abstractions provided by the **PyTorch** framework to define _complex data 
pipelines_ for machine learning. We will explore multiple examples using `torch.utils.data` and the latest `torchdata` with insights and 
best practice for reproducible data and evaluation pipelines.

## Get the material

Clone the current repository, in order to get the course materials. To do so, once connected to your remote machine (via `SSH`), execute the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/pytorch-data-pipelines-tutorial
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `pytorch-data-pipelines-tutorial`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd pytorch-data-pipelines-tutorial
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location. Bear with me another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

### Set up your Environment

To execute the notebooks in this repository, it is necessary to set up the environment. 

Please refer to the [`Get-Ready.ipynb`](./Get-Ready.ipynb) notebook for a step-by-step guide on how to setup the environment, and check that all is working, and ready to go.

**Note**: You could run this notebook directly in [VSCode](https://vscode.dev), or in your existing Jupyter notebook/lab environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook Get-Ready.ipynb
```

### Acknowledgment and funding

The material developed in this tutorial has been supported by the University of Bristol, and by the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) (SSI), as part of my [SSI fellowship](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/valerio-maggio) on `PETs` (Privacy Enchancing Technologies).

Please see this [deck](https://speakerdeck.com/leriomaggio/privacy-enhancing-data-science-ssi-fellowship-2022) to know more about my fellowship plans.

I would also like to thank all the people at [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org) for all the encouragement and support with the preparation of this tutorial.
I hope the material in this repository could contribute to raise awareness about all the amazing work on PETs it's being provided to the Open Source and the Python communities.
